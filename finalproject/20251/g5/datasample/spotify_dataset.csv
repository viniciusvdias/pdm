And I say, ""I don't know Say, ""It's gettin' late, what you wanna do for dinner?"" She says, ""I kinda had a big lunch So I'm not super hungry."" I said, ""Well, you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either But I could eat."" She said, ""So what do you have in mind?"" I said, ""I don't know. What about you?"" She said, ""I don't care ... if you're hungry, let's eat."" I said, ""That's what we're gonna do! But first you gotta tell me What it is you're hungry for!"" And she says, ""Let me think... What's left in our refrigerator?"" I said, ""Well, there's tuna, I know."" She said, ""That went bad a week ago!"" I said, ""Is the chili okay?"" She said, ""You finished that yesterday!"" I hopped up and said ""I don't know; do you want to get something delivered?"" She's like, ""Why would I want to eat liver? I don't even like liver!"" I'm like, ""No, I said 'delivered.'"" She's like, ""I heard you say 'liver'!"" I'm like, ""I should know what I said..."" She's like, ""Whatever! I just don't want any liver!"" Well, I was gonna say something But my cell phone started to ring Now who could be callin' me? Well I checked my caller ID It was just cousin Larry Callin' for the third time today... My wife said, ""Let it go to voicemail."" I said, ""Okay."" ""Where were we? Oh, dinner, right! So what d'ya want to do?"" She said, ""Why don't you whip up somethin' in the kitchen?"" ""Yeah,"" I said, ""why don't you?"" And then she said ""Baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?"" I say, ""No"" She says, ""Yes"" I say, ""No"" She says, ""Yes"" I say, ""No"" She says, ""Yes... Oh, here's your keys"" I step a little bit closer Say, ""Okay, where ya want to go?"" She says, ""How about The Ivy?"" I said, ""Yeah, well, I don't know... I don't feel like gettin all dressed up And eatin' expensive food"" She's says, ""Olive Garden?"" I say, ""Nah, I'm not in the mood... And Burrito King would make me gassy There's no doubt"" She says, ""Just forget about it"" I said, ""No, I swear I'm gonna take you out!"" Then I get an idea I say, ""I know what we'll do!"" She says, ""What?"" I say, ""Guess!"" She says ""What?"" I say, ""We're goin' to the drive-thru!"" So we head out the front door Open the garage door Then I open the car doors And we get in those car doors Put my key in the ignition And then I turn it sideways Then we fasten our seat belts As we pull out the driveway Then we drive to the drive-thru Heading off to the drive-thru We're approaching the drive-thru Getting close to the drive-thru! Almost there at the drive-thru Now we're here at the drive thru Here in line at the drive-thru Did I mention the drive-thru? [Verse 2] Well, here we are In the drive-thru line, me and her Cars in front of us, cars in back of us All just waiting to order There's some idiot in a Volvo With his brights on behind me I lean out the window and scream ""Hey! What you trying to do, blind me?"" My wife says ""Maybe we should park... We could just go eat inside."" I said, ""I'm wearin' bunny slippers So I ain't leavin' this ride..."" Now a woman on a speaker box Is sayin', ""Can I take your order, please?"" I said, ""Yes indeed, you certainly can We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese."" Then my wife says ""Baby, hold on—I've changed my mind! I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time"" I said, ""You always get a cheeseburger!"" She says, ""That's not what I'm hungry for."" I put my head in my hands and scream ""I don't know who you are anymore!"" The voice on the speaker says ""I don't have all day!"" I said, ""Then take our order And we'll be on our way! I wanna get a chicken sandwich And I want a cheeseburger, too"" She's like, ""You want onions on that?"" I'm like, ""Yeah, I already said that I do... Plus we need curly fries And don't you dare forget it! And two medium root beers No, just one—we'll split it."" Then I said ""I'm guessin' that You're probably not too bright... So read me back my order Let's make sure you got it right."" She says ""One—you want a chicken sandwich Two—you want a cheeseburger Three—curly fries, and a large root beer"" ""Stop! Don't go no further!"" ""I never ordered a large root beer I said medium, not large!"" Then she says ""We're havin' a special I supersized you at no charge."" ""Oh."" And that's all I could say, was ""Oh."" And she says ""Now there is somethin' else That I really think you should know You can have unlimited refills For just a quarter more..."" I say ""Great, except we're in the drive-thru... So what would I want that for?"" Then she says ""Wait a minute Your voice sounds so familiar ... hey, is this Paul? And my wife is all like ""No, that ain't Paul Now tell me, who's this Paul?"" She says ""Oh, he's just some guy Who goes to school with me I sat behind him last year And I copied off of him in Geometry"" I said, ""I know a guy named Paul He used to be my plumber He was prematurely bald And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer He also had bladder problems And a really bad infection on his toe."" And she says, ""Mister, please, you can stop right there That's way more than I needed to know!"" And then we both were quiet And things got real intense Then she says ""Next window, please That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents!"" So we inched ahead in line Movin' painfully slow I got a little bored So I turned on the radio... [Black Dog by Led Zeppelin] Click, turned it off Because my wife was getting a headache So we both just sat there quietly for her sake Then I looked at her And she looked back at me And I said ""Um I think you have somethin' in your teeth."" She turned away from me And then turned back and said ""Did I get it?"" I said ""Yeah. Well, I mean, most of it... But hey, ya know, don't sweat it."" Then she said ""How about now?"" I said ""Yeah, almost There's still a little bit there, but don't worry It's probably just a piece of toast."" Now we're at the pay window Or whatever you call it Put my hand in my pocket I can't believe there's no wallet! [Verse 3] And the lady at the window's like ""Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty-two"" I turn around to my wife and say ""How much have you got on you?"" She just rolls her eyes and says ""I'll pay for this, I guess"" So she reaches into her purse And busts out the American Express I hand it to the lady And she says ""Oh, dear It's gotta be cash only We don't take credit cards here"" I took back the card and said ""Gee, really? Well, that sucks"" And that's when I found out My wife was only carryin' three bucks I said, ""I thought you were gonna hit the ATM today"" She says, ""I never got around to it, so where's your wallet anyway?"" And I said, ""Never mind Just help me to find some change..."" Now the lady at the window Is lookin' at me kind of strange... And she says, ""Mister, please We gotta move this line along"" I said, ""Now, hold your stinkin' horses, lady! We won't be long"" So I looked around inside the glove-box And checked the mat beneath my feet I found a nickel in an ashtray And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between the seats Before long I had a little pile Of coins of every sort The lady counts it up and says ""You're still about a dollar short"" And now my woman's got this weird look Frozen on her face She screams, ""You know I wasn't even really hungry in the first place!"" And so I turned around To the cashier again I shrugged and said, ""Okay Forget the chicken sandwich then"" So I pick up my change Pick up my receipt And I drive to the pickup window Man, I just can't wait to eat And now we see this acne-ridden Kid about sixteen Wearin' a dorky nametag that says ""Hello, my name is Eugene"" And he hands me a paper bag I look him in the eyes And I say to him, ""Hey, Eugene Could I get some ketchup for my fries?"" Well, he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he looks at me And I look at him And he says, ""I'm sorry! What did you want again?"" I say ""Ketchup!"" And he says, ""Oh, yeah, that's right... I just spaced out there for a second I'm really kind of burnt tonight."" And then he hands me the ketchup And now we're finally drivin' away And the food is drivin' me mad With its intoxicating bouquet I'm starvin' to death By the time we pull up at the traffic light I say ""Baby, gimme that burger I just gotta have a bite!"" So she reaches in the bag And pulls out the burger And she hands me the burger And I pick up the burger And then I unwrap the paper I bite into those buns And I just can't believe it They forgot the onions!",10:50,sadness,"rock,pop,comedy",Straight Outta Lynwood,26th September 2006,E Maj,108,-14.63db,4-Apr,No,37,34,80,69,8,29,60,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Original Broadway Cast of Into the Woods,Prologue: Into the Woods,0.938314914,Original Broadway Cast of Into the Woods,Our Little World,0.938314914,Roger,I Heard It Through the Grapevine,0.933796746

They said, ""Dad We wanna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota!"" They picked the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota  So the very next day we loaded up the car With potato skins and pickled wieners Crossword puzzles, Spider-Man comics And mama's homemade rhubarb pie Pulled out of the driveway And the neighbors, they all waved good-bye And so began our three-day journey  We picked up a guy holding a sign that said, ""Twine Ball or Bust"" He smelled real bad, and he said his name was Bernie I put in a Slim Whitman tape My wife put on a brand new hair net Kids were in the back seat jumping up and down Yelling, ""Are we there yet?"" And all of us were joined together in one common thought As we rolled down the long and winding interstate In our '53 DeSoto We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota We're headin' for the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Oh, we couldn't wait to get there So we drove straight through for three whole days and nights Of course, we stopped for more pickled wieners now and then The scenery was just so pretty Boy, I wish the kids could've seen it But you can't see out of the side of the car Because the windows are completely covered With the decals from all the places Where we've already been Like Elvis-O-Rama, the Tupperware Museum The Boll Weevil Monument and Cranberry World The Shuffleboard Hall Of Fame, Poodle Dog Rock And The Mecca of Albino Squirrels We've been to ghost towns, theme parks, wax museums And the place where you can drive through the middle of a tree We've seen alligator farms and tarantula ranches But there's still one thing we gotta see  Well, we crossed the state line about 6:39 And we saw the sign that said, ""Twine Ball exit, fifty miles"" Oh, the kids were so happy They started singing ""99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall"" For the twenty-seventh time that day So, we pulled off the road at the Last Chance Gas Station Got a few more pickled wieners and a diet chocolate soda On our way to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Finally, at 7:37 early Wednesday evening As the sun was setting in the Minnesota sky Out in the distance, on the horizon It appeared to me like a vision before my unbelieving eyes I parked the car and walked with awe-filled reverence Toward that glorious, huge, majestic sphere I was just so overwhelmed by its sheer immensity I had to pop myself a beer  Yes, on these hallowed grounds Open ten to eight on weekdays In a little shrine under a makeshift pagoda There sits the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota I tell you, it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota  Oh What on earth would make a man decide to do that kind of thing? Oh Windin' up twenty-one thousand, one hundred forty pounds of string What was he trying to prove? Who was he trying to impress? Why did he build it? How did he do it? It's anybody's guess Where did he get the twine? What was goin' through his mind? Did it just seem like a good idea at the time? Well, we walked up beside it and I warned the kids ""Now, you better not touch it, those ropes are there for a reason"" I said, ""Maybe if you're good, I'll tie it to the back of our car And we can take it home"" But I was only teasin' Then we went to the gift shop and stood in line Bought a souvenir miniature ball of twine Some window decals, and anything else they'd sell us And I bought a couple postcards ""Greetings from the twine ball, wish you were here!"" Won't the folks back home be jealous?  I gave our camera to Bernie and we stood by the ball And we all gathered 'round and said, ""Cheese!"" Then Bernie ran away with my brand new Instamatic But at least we got our memories  So we all just stared at the ball for a while And my eyes got moist, but I said with a smile ""Kids, this here's what America's all about"" Then I started feelin' kinda gooey inside And I fell on my knees and I cried and cried And that's when those security guards threw us out  You know, I bet if we unraveled that sucker It'd roll all the way down to Fargo, North Dakota Cause it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota I'm talkin' 'bout the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota  Well, we stayed that night at the Twine Ball Inn In the morning, we were on our way home again But we really didn't want to leave, that was perfectly clear I said, ""Folks, I can tell you're all sad to go"" Then I winked my eye and I said, ""You know I got a funny kind of feelin' We'll be comin' back again next year"" Cause I've been all around this great big world And I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather go ta Than the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota I said the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota Minnesota Minnesota Minnesota",6:48,joy,"rock,pop,comedy","UHF: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic",18th July 1989,G# Maj,100,-12db,4-Apr,No,28,56,71,74,3,11,63,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mark Knopfler,Trapper Man,0.988047397,Balance and the Traveling Sounds,Something About Us,0.972991163,Blur,Jets,0.97067463

And what can I do if finally for the first time The one I'm burning for returns the glow If love has come at last it's picked the worst time Still I know I've got to go Fly away, meadowlark Fly away in the silver morning If I stay, I'll grow to curse the dark So it's off where the days won't bind me I know, I leave wounds behind me But I won't let tomorrow find me back this way  Before my past once again can blind me, fly away And we won't wait to say goodbye My beautiful young man and I",5:20,sadness,hip hop,Patti LuPone at Les Mouches (Live),28th November 2008,E Maj,94,-6.02db,4-Apr,No,7,63,33,30,10,88,79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Butch Walker,Cigarette Lighter Love Song,0.987289497,X JAPAN,Crucify My Love,0.98534503,"Traditional,Gospel Dream",Nobody knows,0.979462161

Patti Smith,Constantines Dream,"In Arezzo I dreamed a dream Of St. Francis who kneeled and prayed For the birds and the beasts and all human kind  All through the night I felt drawn in by him And I heard him call Like a distant hymn  I retreated from the silence of my room Stepping down the ancient stones washed with dawn And entered the basilica that bore his name Seeing his effigy I bowed my head And my racing heart I gave to him I kneeled and prayed And sleep that I could not find in the night I found through him I saw before me the world of his world The bright fields, the birds in abundance All of nature of which he sang Singing of him All the beauty that surrounded him as he walked His nature that was nature itself And I heard him--I heard him speak And the birds sang sweetly And the wolves licked his feet But I could not give myself to him I felt another call from the basilica itself The call of art--the call of man And the beauty of the material drew me away  And I awoke, and beheld upon the wall The dream of Constantine The handiwork of Piero della Francesca Who had stood where I stood And with his brush stroked the legend of the True Cross And he envisioned Constantine advancing to greet the enemy But as he was passing the river An unaccustomed fear gripped his bowels An anticipation so overwhelming that it manifested in waves  All thru the night a dream drew toward him As an advancing Crusade He slept in his tent on the battlefield While his men stood guard And an angel awoke him Constantine within his dream awoke And his men saw a light pass over the face of the King The troubled King And the angel came and showed to him The sign of the true cross in heaven And upon it was written In this sign shall thou conquer  In the distance the tents of his army were lit by moonlight But another kind of radiance lit the face of Constantine And in the morning light The artist, seeing his work was done Saw it was good  In this sign shall thou conquer  He let his brush drop and passed into a sleep of his own And he dreamed of Constantine carrying him into battle in his right hand An immaculate undefiled and single white Cross Piero della Francesca, as his brush stroked the wall Was filled with the torpor And fell into a dream of his own  From the geometry of his heart he mapped it out He saw the King rise, fitted with armor Set upon a white horse An immaculate cross in his right hand He advanced toward the enemy And the symmetry, the perfection of his mathematics Caused the scattering of the enemy Agitated, broken, they fled And Piero dela Francesca, waking, cried out All is art--all is future! Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure With a brush and an eye full of light But as he advanced in age The light was shorn from his eyes And blinded, he layed upon his bed On an October morning, 1492, and whispered Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure Oh Lord let me die on the back of adventure  And a world away--a world away On three great ships Adventure itself as if to answer Pulling into the New World And as far as his eyes could see No longer blind All of nature, unspoiled--beautiful--beautiful And such a manner that would have lifted The heart of St. Francis Into the realm of universal love  Columbus set foot on the New World And witnessed beauty unspoiled All of the delights given by God As if in Eden itself--as if Eden had opened up her heart to him And opened her dress And all of her fruit gave to him And Columbus so overwhelmed Fell into a sleep of his own All the world in his sleep All of the beauty--all of the beauty entwined with the future  The twenty-first century Advancing like the angel Advancing like the angel that had come To Constantine Constantine in his dream Oh this is your cross to bear Oh Lord Oh Lord let me deliver Hallowed adventure to all mankind  In the future Oh art cried the painter Oh art--Oh art--cried the angel Art the great material gift of man Art that hath denied The humble pleas of St. Francis  Oh thou Artist All shall crumble Into dust Oh thou navigator The terrible end of man This is your gift to mankind This is your cross to bear And Columbus Saw all of nature aflame The apocalyptic night And the dream Of the troubled king Dissolved into light",10:19,anger,"garage rock,punk rock,rock",Banga,1st June 2012,A min,103,-8.97db,4-Apr,No,15,57,56,46,6,28,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,Utopia,Freak Parade,0.971882824,Phish,Gumbo,0.966742921,Grateful Dead,Love,0.964303892

The cold-blooded moon    The captain waits above the celebration    Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid    Whose ebony face is beyond communication    The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.        They shaved her head    She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo    A messenger arrived with a black nightingale    I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow    Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.        I stumbled to my feet    I rode past destruction in the ditches    With the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo    Renegade priests and treacherous young witches    Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.        The palace of mirrors    Where dog soldiers are reflected    The endless road and the wailing of chimes    The empty rooms where her memory is protected    Where the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times.        She wakes him up    Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking    Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks    She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking    He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.    Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes    I've moved your mountains and marked your cards    But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination    Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.        Peace will come    With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire    But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall    And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating    Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

Robyn Hitchcock,Uncorrected Personality Traits,"Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child May prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult Lack of involvement with the father, or over-involvement with the mother Can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual peers And in homosexual leanings, narcissism, transexuality (Girls from the waist up, men from the waist down) Attempts to be your own love object Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once! Even Marilyn Monroe was a man, but this tends to get overlooked By our mother-fixated, overweight, sexist media So, uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child May prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult  If you give in to them every time they cry They will become little tyrants but they won't remember why Then when they are thwarted by people in later life They will become psychotic and they won't make an ideal husband or wife The spoiled baby grows into The escapist teenager who's The adult alcoholic who's The middle-aged suicide.
