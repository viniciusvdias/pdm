# Final project report: *\<include your title here\>*

## 1. Context and motivation

- What is the main goal? What problem are you trying to solve with big data?

## 2. Data

### 2.1 Detailed description

- Describe the dataset(s) used in your project.
  - Where does the data come from? Include the source/link.
  - What does the data contain? (number of records, type of features, etc.)
  - If data is generated, explain how and include instructions to generate a sample with Docker.

### 2.2 How to obtain the data

- A small sample dataset (at most 1MB, preferably less) must be included in the `datasample/` folder of this repository. This sample is required so the project can be tested quickly.
- For the full dataset only (not the sample), provide clear instructions on how to download or generate it. Do not include the full dataset in the repository.
- For example, you can provide public links to the data and commands on how to download them using tools like `wget` (this can also be wrapped in a Docker container):

  ```bash
  wget https://path-to-your-public-dataset/data.zip
  unzip data.zip -d data/
  ```

- If the dataset is hosted on cloud storage (Google Drive, HTTPS, AWS S3, etc.), provide the public link and the necessary commands.
- If the data must be generated, provide the Docker command to generate it.

## 3. How to install and run

> Observation: The project must be compatible with a default Docker installation and use only Docker containers for running. No external tools or installations should be necessary — this is a strict requirement.

### 3.1 Quick start (using sample data in `datasample/`)

- Give the exact command(s) to run your project out of the box using Docker or your scripts.
- Example:

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build
  # or if using a script:
  ./bin/run.sh
  ```

### 3.2 How to run with the full dataset

- Explain clearly how to configure or mount the full dataset (if different from default sample).

## 4. Project architecture

- Include a diagram of your system’s architecture and a description of how the components interact. Images are encouraged for clarity.
- What are the main components? How do they interact?
- Example diagram (replace with your own):

  ```
  [Data Source] → [Data Ingestion] → [Processing] → [Results Storage]
  ```

- Mention which parts run in which containers, and how data flows between them.

## 5. Workloads evaluated

- Specify each big data task evaluated in your project (queries, data pre-processing, sub-routines, etc.).
- Be specific: describe the details of each workload, and give each a clear name. These named workloads will be referenced and evaluated via performance experiments in the next section.
  - Example: [WORKLOAD-1] Query that computes the average occupation within each
    time window (include query below). [WORKLOAD-2] Preprocessing, including
  removing duplicates, standardization, etc.

## 6. Experiments and results

### 6.1 Experimental environment

- Describe the environment used for experiments (machine/VM specs, OS, Docker version, etc.).
- Example:
  > Experiments were run on a virtual machine with 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04, Docker 24.x.

### 6.2 What did you test?

- What parameters did you try changing? What did you measure (e.g. throughput, latency, wall-clock time, resident memory, disk usage, application level metrics)?
- The ideal is that, for each execution configuration, you repeat the experiments a number of times (replications). With this information, report the average and also the variance/deviation of the results.

### 6.3 Results

- Use tables and plots (insert images).
- Discuss your results: What do they mean? What did you learn about the data or
about the computational cost of processing this data?
- Do not just show numbers or plots — always explain what they mean and why they matter.

## 7. Discussion and conclusions

- Summarize what worked and what did not.
- Discuss any challenges or limitations of this work.

## 8. References and external resources

- List all external resources, datasets, libraries, and tools you used (with links).
